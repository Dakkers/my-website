<h1>The Collatz Conjecture</h1>
<small><i>"Mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such problems."</i>   ~ Paul Erdos (allegedly)</small>

<p>This webpage is for an interactive doohickey for the Collatz conjecture, which, in my
  opinion, is one of the most interesting unsolved problems in mathematics (but perhaps 
  I am just a boring person).<br><br>

  The Collatz conjecture (also known as the 3n+1 conjecture) states this: start with a 
  positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 
  1. Repeat this process. n will eventually reach 1, and then go to 4, and then to 2, and 
  then 1, etc. More formally speaking, the iterates of n will eventually converge to the 
  3-cycle {4, 2, 1}. Enter a number below to see its iterates as well as a graph of its 
  iterates vs. iteration number.

<p>We define the <strong>total stopping time</strong> to be the number of iterations 
  needed to reach a value of 1 (the first time). Pick two numbers below to see a 
  graph of total stopping time vs. initial values. Be warned: picking a number above 
  1000 will get pretty slow.</p>
