<div id="intro">
    <h4>Introduction and History</h2>
    <p>The Lorenz system is one of the most studied chaotic systems, and helped begin the modern 
    study of chaos. The idea of chaos has been around since the 1800s but was not rigorously 
    developed until the 1960s when Edward Lorenz started investigating his now famous system. 
    Thanks to a complete accident, Lorenz noticed that his weather model was very sensitive to 
    the input, producing wildly different results for slightly different inputs. Wanting to 
    understand how a completely deterministic system could behave in such a seemingly 
    unpredictable way, Lorenz eventually simplified his model to a system of three non-linear 
    differential equations and studied their properties. Upon presenting his study of this system 
    and with the suggestion of his colleagues, term “butterfly effect” was coined and he developed 
    a lifelong interest in chaos theory. Thanks to the development of computers, the field grew 
    quickly and with Lorenz’s system being applied to many physical systems.</p>

    <p>While the ideas of chaos theory are relatively old, the field required the advent of 
    electronic computers to develop. Its roots are in ergodic where the long term behavior of 
    systems is considered. Usually dynamic systems will either diverge completely or converge to 
    a fix point or cycle. As an example consider two moving heavy bodies interacting through 
    gravity; either they will fly apart, collapse to a single mass or form a stable orbit around 
    each other. Now when three heavy bodies are examined, things become much more difficult. Henri 
    Poincare showed that there is no analytic solution but there are still non-repeating orbits 
    such that the three objects never fly apart or collapse. Other scientists were also encountering 
    systems where things were deterministic and quasi stable but not repeating, especially in fluid 
    mechanics and complicated circuits. To fully explore these systems often required repeated 
    computational solutions (which were done sparingly, if ever) and were done by hand until the 
    1950's when computers became cheap and powerful enough for researchers.  At last, scientists 
    could see systems develop over time and how their behavior was affected by small changes.</p>

    <p>Around 1960, Lorenz was using a LGP-30 to model weather when he reran an experiment and 
    noticed something peculiar. Trying to save time, he had restarted his experiment with printout 
    data from half way through the first run but soon found that the new experiment predicted 
    completely divergent weather. Since the only differences between the two runs was the numbers 
    rounded to three decimals on the printout, compared to the six decimals kept in the computer's 
    memory, he concluded that his model was very sensitive to small changes of input. This fascinated 
    Lorenz; he was hooked. He spent the remainder of his career studying this and other chaotic 
    systems, pioneering a new field of mathematics.</p>

<div id="deriv">
    <h4>Derivation of System</h4>
    <p>To understand what was happening in his computer, Lorenz needed a simplified version to study. 
    He focused on two dimensional convection which can be described by:

        $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \nabla ^2 = - \frac{\partial \left( \psi, \nabla ^ 2 \psi \right)}{\partial \left( x, z \right)} + \nu \nabla ^4 \psi + g \alpha \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}$$
        $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \theta = - \frac{\partial \left( \psi, \theta \right)}{\partial \left( x, z \right)} + \frac{\Delta T}{H} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} + \kappa \nabla ^2 \theta$$


    The variables are defined as:</p>

    <p class="p-indented">$\psi$ - the stream function whose components are tangent to fluid velocity
    vectors;<br>
    $\theta$ - a function of temperature departure (deviation from average);<br>
    $g, \alpha, \nu, \kappa$ - gravitational acceleration, buoyancy, kinematic viscosity, thermal 
    conductivity;<br>
    $\Delta T$ - the change in temperature from top to bottom;
    $H$ - the depth of fluid cell</p>

    <p>Previous work by Lord Rayleigh (John Strutt) had produced the solutions:

        $$\psi = \psi_0 \sin \left(\frac{\pi\alpha x}{H} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi z}{H} \right)$$
        $$\theta = \theta_0 \cos \left(\frac{\pi\alpha x}{H} \right) \sin \left(\frac{\pi z}{H} \right)$$

    Provided that

        $$R_\alpha = \frac{g\alpha H^3 \Delta T}{\nu\kappa}$$

    exceeds a critical value,

        $$R_c = \frac{\pi^4 (1 + a^2)^3}{a^2}$$

    where $a$ is proportional to the length of the convection cell.

    Using Fourier series and numerical integration, Barry Saltzman obtained a system of differential 
    equations. It was this set that Lorenz was using in his computer. Interested mostly in longer term 
    behavior, Lorenz noticed that only three terms did not tend to zero therefore he could reduce his system 
    to three equations: 

        $$\frac{dx}{dt} = \sigma (y - x)$$
        $$\frac{dy}{dt} = rx - y - xz$$
        $$\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - bz$$

    Where the variables are defined as follows:</p>

    <p class="p-indented">$x$ is proportional to the intensity of convective motion;<br>
    $y$ is proportional to the temperature difference between ascending and descending currents;<br>
    $z$ is proportional to the distortion (away from linearity) of the vertical temperature profile</p>

    <p>where the constants are

        $$\sigma = \frac{\nu}{\kappa}$$
        $$r = \frac{R_a}{R_c}$$
        $$b = \frac{4}{1 + a^2}$$

    $\sigma$ is called the Prandtl number, $r$ is proportional to the Rayleigh number, and $b$ is proportional 
    to the physical proportions of the region. Using numerical integration, he was able to demonstrate how, 
    for certain constant values, small 
    changes in the initial conditions would create large changes in the final results. He also argued for the 
    existence of non-periodic solutions which in later studies produced a picture resembling a butterfly, thus 
    the butterfly effect was coined. This system now bears his name and is arguably the start of chaos 
    research as a separate discipline.

    <h4>Quantitative Analysis</h4>
    <p><strong>Linearization: Jacobian & Eigenvalues</strong><br>
    Thankfully, there is some useful analysis which can be done by hand as well. The first thing to do 
    is find fixed points of the system, i.e. constant real values for x, y and z in terms of σ, ρ and β that satisfy 
    the equations, all of which are real and positive. The obvious answer is all parameters equal zero. Now 
    the Jacobian is:

        $$\begin{bmatrix}-\sigma & \sigma & 0 \\ r - z & -1 & -x & \\ y & x & -b\end{bmatrix}$$

    </p>

    <p><strong>The Origin as a Fixed Point</strong><br>
    By looking at the equations, it is clear that the origin is a fixed point. Evaluating the Jacobian gives:

        $$\begin{bmatrix} -\sigma & \sigma & 0 \\ r & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -b \end{bmatrix} $$

    We then find the eigenvalues of J0:

        $$|J_0 - \lambda I| = \begin{vmatrix} -\sigma - \lambda & \sigma & 0 \\ r & -1 -\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -b - \lambda \end{vmatrix} = 0$$
        $$= (-\sigma - \lambda)(-1 - \lambda)(-b - \lambda) - r\sigma(-b - \lambda)$$
        $$= -(b + \lambda)(\lambda^2 + (\sigma + 1)\lambda + \sigma(1 - r))$$

    Thus there are three eigenvalues: 

        $$\lambda_1 = \frac{-(\sigma + 1) + \sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r}}{2}$$
        $$\lambda_2 = \frac{-(\sigma + 1) - \sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r}}{2}$$
        $$\lambda_3 = -b$$

    Note that all eigenvalues are real since all parameters are positive, making the discriminant always 
    positive. <br>

    At the origin fixed point, there are three cases of importance: $0 < r < 1$, $r = 1$, $r > 1$ .</p>

    <p><strong>Case 1: $0 < r < 1$ </strong><br>
    By assumption, $r - 1 < 0$ and so: 

        $$\sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r} = \sqrt{\sigma^2 - 2\sigma + 1 + 4\sigma r} = \sqrt{(\sigma + 1)^2 + 4(r - 1)\sigma} < \sqrt{(\sigma + 1)^2} = \sigma + 1$$

    From this we see that all eigenvalues are negative:

        $$\lambda_1 = \frac{-(\sigma + 1) + \sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r}}{2} < 0$$
        $$\lambda_2 = \frac{-(\sigma + 1) - \sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r}}{2} < 0$$
        $$\lambda_3 = -b < 0$$

    Thus, if we are within this range, the origin is an asymptotically stable critical point. From a 
    meteorological interpretation, all convection eventually stops.</p>

    <p><strong>Case 2: $r = 1$</strong>
    In this case, the eigenvalues simplify to:

        $$\lambda_1 = 0$$
        $$\lambda_2 = -(\sigma + 1)$$
        $$\lambda_3 = -b$$

    In this case, the origin is a neutrally stable critical point. Physically, this agreed with Rayleigh's result 
    since $R_o = R_c$.</p>

    <p><strong>Case 3: $r > 1$</strong>
    By assumption, $r > 1$ and so:

        $$\sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r} > \sqrt{(\sigma + 1)^2} = \sigma + 1$$

    From this we see that:

        $$\lambda_1 = \frac{-(\sigma + 1) + \sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r}}{2} > 0$$
        $$\lambda_2 = \frac{-(\sigma + 1) - \sqrt{(\sigma - 1)^2 + 4\sigma r}}{2} < 0$$
        $$\lambda_3 = -b < 0$$

    Thus, if we are within this range, the origin is an asymptotically unstable critical point. Physically, this 
    shows that convection occurs. <br>
     
    It is seen then that as ρ passes through one, the origin goes from stable and unstable. This one is a 
    bifurcation point for the Lorentz system. It can be shown that this point is indeed a pitchfork bifurcation 
    point, with the origin becoming an unstable point and two new stable points arising. </p>

    <p><strong>Following the Pitchfork</strong><br>
    In order to show the emergence of these critical points, consider $\vec{v} = [x, y, z]^T$. If $x = 0$, then 
    since $\sigma \neq 0$, $y = 0$ also. Furthermore, since $b \neq 0$, $z = 0$ also. Thus if $x = 0$, 
    $\vec{v} = 0$. Now consider $v$ is a critical point and $v \neq 0$ and by the previous argument, $x \neq 0$ 
    also (contrapositive argument). But, since it is a critical point, the first equation yields:

        $$\frac{dx}{dt} = 0 = \sigma (y - x)$$

    thus $x = y$. From the second equation:

        $$\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 = rx - y - xz = rx - x - xz = x(r - 1 - z)$$

    and since $x \neq 0$ by assumption, $z = r - 1$. <br>

    From the third equation:

        $$\frac{dz}{dt} = 0 = xy - bz = x^2 - bz = x^2 - b(r - 1)$$

    thus: $x = y = \pm \sqrt{b(p - 1)}$. In summary two critical points were just found:

        $$\vec{p} = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{b(r - 1)} \\ \sqrt{b(r-1)} \\ r - 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
        $$\vec{q} = \begin{bmatrix} -\sqrt{b(r - 1)} \\ -\sqrt{b(r-1)} \\ r - 1 \end{bmatrix} $$

    By analyzing \vec{p}, the Jacobian at this critical point is: 

        $$J_p = \begin{bmatrix} -\sigma & \sigma & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & -\sqrt{b(r - 1)} \\ \sqrt{b(p-1)} & \sqrt{b(p-1)} & -b \end{bmatrix}$$

    We then find the eigenvalues of $J_0$: 

        $$|J_p - \lambda I| = \begin{vmatrix} -\sigma - \lambda & \sigma & 0 \\ 1 & -1 - \lambda & -\sqrt{b(r - 1)} \\ \sqrt{b(p-1)} & \sqrt{b(p-1)} & -b - \lambda \end{vmatrix} = 0$$
        $$(-\sigma - \lambda)((-1 - \lambda) (-b - \lambda) + b(p - 1)) - \sigma(-b - \lambda + b(r-1))$$
        $$\lambda^3 + (\sigma + b + 1)\lambda^2 + b(\sigma + r)\lambda + 2b\sigma(r - 1)$$

    This is rather messy. With luck, q need not be explicitly solved as well as its Jacobian yields the same 
    characteristic equation. This can be seen by recognizing the system is symmetric about the z-axis. That is, 
    if $X(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)]^T$ is a solution, then so is $Y(t) = [-x(t), -y(t), z(t)]^T$. Then $\vec{p}$ and 
    $\vec{q}$ have the same behaviour for all parameter values. Thus only the dynamics of $\vec{p}$ need to be 
    considered if analyzed. Most importantly, these two points are the centers about which the Lorentz attractor 
    is situated.</p>

    <h4>Qualitative Analysis</h4>   
    <p>Due to the difficulty of calculation, situations of varying $r > 1$ are only discussed qualitatively. There are 
    many more interesting regions. We look at six cases in particular. These regions use $\sigma = 10$ and $b = 8/3$.</p>

    <p><strong>Case 1: $0 < r < 1$</strong><br>
    For values of $r$ less than 1, the equations have only one fixed point, the origin,
    which is attracting. This leads to no-chaotic behaviour as all trajectories tend
    to it.</p>

    <!-- <object id="svg1" type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/0.5.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object> -->

    <p><strong>Case 2: $1 \leq r < 13.926$</strong><br>
    At $r = 1$ a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation takes place causing the origin
    to become unstable and two stable attracting points $C1$ and $C2 $ to appear,
    these are the loci of the system for all higher $r$ values. The points remain
    globally attracting until $r = 13:926...$</p>

    <!-- <object id="svg2" type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/9.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object> -->

    <p><strong>Case 3: $13.926 \leq r < 24.06$</strong><br>
    At $r=13.926...$ the system experiences transient chaos, as the an unstable limit cycle moves from the origin 
    towards $C1$ and $C2$. Thus trajectories will orbit chaotically around the two points until eventually staring 
    to approach one asymptomatically, the red curve is a chaotically orbiting trajectory and the green is one 
    started much closer to an attracting point and thus is already approaching it.</p>

    <!-- <object id="svg3" type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/13.926.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object> -->

    <p><strong>Case 4: $24.06 \leq r < 24.74$</strong><br>
    At $r=24.06$ the transient chaos ceases and the system becomes a strange attractor. This is due to the unstable 
    limit cycles becoming so close to the stable points that trajectories can no longer cross it. Even though the 
    green curve starts very close to an attracting point it is still repelled and eventually participates in the 
    strange attractor.</p>

    <!-- <object id="svg4" type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/24.06.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object> -->

    <p><strong>Case 5: $r = 24.74$</strong><br>
    At $r=24.74$ the unstable limit cycle reaches the stable points resulting in a supcritical Hopf bifurcation 
    and all points become unstable. $r=28$ is the value studied most intently by Lorenz and is known as the Lorenz 
    attractor; 28 was picked since it is a round number in the low end of the regime.</p>

    <!-- <object id="svg5" type="image/svg+xml" data="/img/24.74.svg">Your browser does not support SVG</object> -->

    <p><strong>Case 6: $r > 24.74$</strong><br>
    As $r$ continues to increase the number of periodic orbits grows to infinity at around 100 then decreases 
    for higher values this type of behaviour characterizes much of what is known about large $r$ values although 
    much is still unknown. For comparison the Lorenz attractor ($r=28$ is plotted in green, the similarity between 
    the two is striking).</p>

    <h4>The Lorenz Attractor</h4>
    <p>First, it would be wise to define what an attractor is.</p>

    <p>An attractor is defined as a set of physical properties toward which a system tends to evolve, regardless 
    of the starting conditions of the system. During all values of $r$, the Lorentz system has attractive point(s). 
    The interesting (and more difficultly analyzed) property of the Lorentz system is when $r > 13.925$. At this 
    point, something strange starts to form. Justly named so, we begin to see what is known as a strange 
    attractor. </p>

    <p>A strange attractor is defined as an attractor of fractal structure. Excluding values of $r$ greater than 
    around 100, non-repeating cycles around this attractor appear. Interestingly, the volume of attractor is 
    bound given a starting position, though no two trajectories overlap. </p>

    <p>The following set of inputs allow you to observe the Lorenz attractor form. The set $x_0, y_0, z_0$ represent 
    the initial $x,y,z$ coordinates; $t_0$ represents the initial time; $t_f$ represents the final time; $N$ 
    represents the number of steps used; and $\sigma, r, b$ represent the parameters discussed previously. Two 
    more options are available: a specified ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver, and the speed at which 
    the graphs are rendered. Two ODE solvers are available: the Euler method (type in 'euler' without quotes), or 
    the fourth-order Runge Kutta method (type in 'rk4'). </p>

    <p>If no values are specified, the placeholder values are used, with the exception of $x_0,y_0,z_0$, which are 
    actually random numbers in the interval $[-5, 5)$.</p>
