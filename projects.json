I decided to rent a DigitalOcean server and I set up a MongoDB database so the user's data wouldn't be sucked dry (the data loaded into the browser was a 2.4 MB JSON file). The second revision I did was to reduce the reliance on jQuery for editing the view; I decided to try out KnockoutJS, which is what the app uses now, and it's pretty freaking cool.
